Diwali Sales Analysis: Cleaning and EDA

In the process of Diwali sales analysis, cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) play crucial roles. Cleaning involves removing errors and inconsistencies from the dataset, ensuring that the data is accurate and reliable. This step ensures that the analysis is based on high-quality data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves understanding the structure and patterns within the data. It includes tasks like visualizing the data to identify trends, correlations, and outliers. EDA helps us gain insights into customer behavior, popular products, and sales trends during the Diwali period.

By performing cleaning and EDA on Diwali sales data, we can uncover valuable insights that help businesses make informed decisions. This process is essential for understanding customer preferences, optimizing marketing strategies, and maximizing sales during the festive season.
